The Goal
--------
Updraft is a simple PDF viewer for MacOS using PDFKit.

It exists because I wanted one feature: when the text has a link to a note
elsewhere in the text I wanted to be able to bring the note up in a separate
window so I can see the note and what it describes at the same time.
This obvious feature seems to be lacking from every other PDF reader.
I don't understand how people use PDF readers without this feature.

Methodology
-----------
This code was entirelt written by ChatGPT.
I produced the icon myself using Pixelmator Pro.
